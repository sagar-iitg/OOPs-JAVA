Hi

This zip file contains a software challenge.
The challenge will allow you to show off your
object oriented software development skills.

The zip file contains source code for a program 
that processes a mixture of items.
The program is written using C style.

The program can be built and run using Microsoft Visual Studio (MSVS) or by using standard linux tools.  
For MSVS, open the included solution file.  
For linux, cd to the directory containing makefile.mk
then execute gmake -f makefile.mk

Your goal is to rewrite the program using object-oriented style with any language of your preference, e.g. C++ or Java. 
 
Please be sure to test that the program runs as you expect it to.

When you are satisfied with your changes,
please email the files to me.

Feel free to use any written material.
Do not ask or allow any person to help you.

There is no fixed time limit.
A quality solution is the most important aspect.
Sending the solution sooner is better, but 
time is secondary to a well crafted solution.

Thank you,
